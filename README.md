# Task 1
# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, 
and virginica.   

• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine 
possessing measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species.

• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these 
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding 
species.

• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into 
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it 
ideal for introductory learning experiences
# Task 2
# SUPERSTORE SALES PREDICTION
● Time series analysis deals with time series based data to extract patterns for 
predictions and other characteristics of the data.
● It uses a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on 
previous observations.
● It is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather 
data, stock prices, and retail sales forecasting.
# Task 3
# CAR PRICE PREDICTION
• Numerous factors contribute to a car's price, encompassing brand reputation, 
car features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more. 
• Car price prediction stands as a significant domain within machine learning 
research.
• If you seek to master the art of training a car price prediction model, this 
project presents a valuable learning opportunity.
